# eSports Tournament Management System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive eSports tournament management system built with PHP/MySQL. The platform manages tournament registrations, match scheduling, screenshot uploads, result management, and final tournament winner selection.

## Project Architecture

### Key Components
- **User System**: Registration, authentication, wallet management
- **Tournament Management**: Creation, registration, match generation
- **Match System**: Individual match results, screenshot uploads
- **Admin Panel**: Tournament oversight, result verification, final winner selection
- **Payment System**: Entry fees, prize distribution

### Database Structure
- `tournaments` - Tournament information and settings
- `matches` - Individual match data
- `match_screenshots` - User-uploaded match evidence
- `tournament_registrations` - User tournament signups
- `users` - Player accounts and profiles

## Current Implementation Status

### Match Flow
1. **User Match View**: Users can view their matches in `user/matches.php`
2. **Screenshot Upload**: Users upload match evidence via upload form
3. **Admin Review**: Admins review screenshots in `admin/results.php` 
4. **Match Winner**: Admin selects individual match winner (not tournament winner)
5. **Tournament Winners**: Final tournament positions selected in `admin/tournament_results.php`

### Key Distinction
- **Match Winners**: Individual game results (determined per match)
- **Tournament Winners**: Overall tournament rankings (Champion, Runner-up, 3rd Place)
